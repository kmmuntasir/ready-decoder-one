## 👋 What is this?

*Ready Player One* is a visual feast for gamers and movie geeks, packed with pop-culture references from every era. But not everyone catches them all—and that's okay!

**This project** is a lovingly crafted HTML slideshow built to be watched alongside the movie. It highlights and explains many of the key references—characters, games, movies, moments—that fly across the screen faster than the DeLorean.

It was originally made to help my wife enjoy the film without pausing every 30 seconds. You're welcome to use it for your own movie nights or geeky dates!
